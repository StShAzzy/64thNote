milestones in 64th Note history

03/31/07 - 64th Note v1.2 beta 3
         * Extended File Info
         * Multiple user settings support
         * Built with MSVS 2005 (All older versions were MSVS6)

08/17/06 - 64th Note v1.2 beta 1
         * better AI interrupt handling

02/10/06 - 64th Note v1.1 FINAL released
         * Proper initialization of tag flags (FIFOFull, CountException)
         * 1.1 has been stable for a while, it's time to get the memory fix out there.

12/04/05 - 64th Note v1.1 beta 4 released
         * In a lot of situations the Fade Type dropdown list didn't appear, this has been fixed.
           Also, "no fade" has been added as an option, for those who would like an abrupt ending
           (or want to let their output plugin handle it)

12/03/05 - 64th Note v1.1 beta 3 released
         * reg caching reenabled (was disabled in beta 2, it caused problems which are now fixed), better speed

12/03/05 - 64th Note v1.1 beta 2 released
         * implemented method for register access via exception handler that works with new memory allocation,
           needed for several games, also allows Animal Forest to run under interpreter

11/29/05 - 64th Note v1.1 beta 1 released
         * changed memory allocation, seems to fix some problems (in_tv)

11/23/05 - 64th Note v1.0 FINAL released
         * Escape key now closes windows properly
         * no bug reports for long enough to call it FINAL

11/05/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 23 released
         * AI FIFO full setting added (Excitebike 64), uses _enableFIFOfull tag

10/31/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 22 released
         * removed DirectSound buffer problem workaround, turned out to be unneeded
         * pause/unpause now only occur when they'd actually do something (fixed ASIO crash)
         * updated in_usf.ini (Mario Kart 64 no longer set for Auto Audio HLE, Shadowgate 64 added)

10/26/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 21 released
         * Fixed bug with loading save states with FR in the status reg set (Turok 3)
         * Workaround for a buffer problem with DirectSound output plugin, track would
           cut off half second too soon

10/10/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 20 released
         * made it impossible to open two info windows at once (Winamp shouldn't allow anyway)
         * switched more errors from MessageBox to DisplayError, so they'll be controlled by the
           configuration

10/07/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 19 released
         * fixed issue where emulation runs full-speed on track end (eating all available CPU), now
           safer to use with higher priority

10/06/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 18 released
         * removed "speed fix" from last version, actually only made things worse

10/05/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 17 released
         * greatly improved CPU sharing behavior (esp. in Chopper Attack, Snowboard Kids)
         * INI settings will return to default if not set by the current version
         * clarified help
         * changed a few things because windows doesn't actually require two carriage returns
           in multiline edit boxes

09/29/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 16 released
         * round frequency now uses in_usf.ini for its values
         * also round frequency will default to the old algorithm and use the nearest mutliple of
           50 Hz as the frequency if no setting is found for a specific dacrate

09/27/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 15 released
         * removed a warning and interrupt in GenerateSectionLinkages (needed for Mario Tennis)
         * added Auto Audio HLE

09/26/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 14 released
         * fixed tab order, focus in dialogs

09/26/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 13 released (30 minutes later)
         * cleaned up dialog design issues

09/26/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 12 released
         * added alternate fade types (linear, log, cos)
         * cleaned out unused options
         * added "Track" field to USF Info window
         * changed "Tagger" to "Tagged by"
         * generally rearranged USF Info window

09/21/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 11 released
         * removed unused debug, COM, GUI, profiling, FPS, pause/stepping stuff (saved 84 kb)
         * reduced CPU Thread termination timeout on close to .2 seconds (rather than 2 seconds)
         * first source release for 1.0

09/15/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 10 released
         * (Hopefully) fixes track skipping problem (end of track message now only sent once).

09/15/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 9 released
         * fixed an issue with timing in XMPlay
         * cleaned up some audio code
         * added help box
         * raw tags now editable

09/13/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 8 released
         * Added Azimer's Audio HLE from Mupen 0.5

09/12/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 7 released
         * seek backwards added as an option
         * detect silence disabled by default

09/12/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 6 released
         * error display now optional
         * loading errors now handled more gracefully, should be able to skip without crashing
         * redid "64th" part of logo, smaller file size

09/12/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 5 released
         * fixed config dialog so whole cpu priority name can be seen
         * fixed problem with tracks without fade tag taking on previous track's fade
         * fixed bugs with Play Forever (fade cannot be set if length=0, clearly the fade
           will end at the very beginning and start before the track starts, so now fade
           is cleared on loading)

09/09/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 4 released
         * Fixed a bug in RSP where it would attempt to deallocate already deallocated memory
           (this fixes at least one crash bug). I went ahead and cleared up similar situations
           anywhere else VirtualFree was used.
         * silence detection now won't end a track until it's actually played to the point where
           the silence starts, which should fix things for users with large buffers (before the
           track would end as soon as the specified amount of silence was *rendered*)
         * fixed bug wherein default length wouldn't be used
         * added "always use default length" option (by request)
         * rearranged config dialog
         * switched config settings to plugin.ini

09/07/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 3 released
         * fixed timing (switched cumulative time from long to double)
         * cleaned up end of track shutdown

09/06/05 - 64th Note v1.0 beta 2 released
         * complete rewrite (except for a few bits of audio output and UI)
         * first released beta of 1.0 (beta 1 was internal)
         * using Project 64 1.6 CPU core (rather than 1.4 as in previous versions)
         * uses winamp.ini for storing settings
         * only one DLL needed

08/23/05 - work begins on v1.0

07/22/05 - decided to rewrite 64th Note

07/16/05 - 64th Note v0.10 beta 2 released
         * round frequency option introduced, default is now actual N64 frequency
         * fixed info window writing tags to another file if it track changes while editing
         * title can default to file name or just leave missing tags blank

07/14/05 - 64th Note v0.10 beta 1 released
         * added tagger field to editor
         * fixed fade-up after track end

04/19/05 - 64th Note v0.09 released
         * Fixed uninitalized STATUS reg (PJ64 save state bug). This fixes the problem where
           playing certain track in order would freeze, for example Pilotwings after Perfect Dark.
         * Cleaned up RSP setup/teardown.
         * Fixed a minor, unimportant registry bug.
         * Removed a lot of useless error messages and rephrased the important ones ("what's in
           code?" now actually tells you you're using an old USF, "seeking backwards not supported"
           is removed, etc.)
         - People who used to experience a lot of crashes report that v0.09 hasn't crashed at all.

         * Volume control: overall and individual USFs
